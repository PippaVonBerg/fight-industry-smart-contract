# Fight Industry Smart Contract

## Overview

This repository contains a smart contract designed for managing agreements in the fight industry. It is built using Solidity and aims to streamline payment processes between service providers and fight leagues.

## Purpose

The smart contract facilitates:
- **Milestone-based payments**: Payments are released only when specific milestones are completed.
- **Transparency**: Both parties can track progress and payments.
- **Security**: Reduces the risk of disputes by clearly defining terms.

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: The contract is initialized with the total contract value and the number of milestones.
2. **Adding Milestones**: The service provider can add milestones that represent key deliverables.
3. **Completing Milestones**: The client (fight league) can mark milestones as completed.
4. **Releasing Payments**: Payments are made for completed milestones only.

## Code Structure

The main components of the smart contract include:
- `constructor`: Initializes the contract with key details.
- `addMilestone`: Allows the service provider to add new milestones.
- `completeMilestone`: Marks a milestone as complete.
- `releaseMilestonePayment`: Releases payment for a completed milestone.

## Security Measures

The contract includes basic security checks to ensure:
- Only authorized parties can add milestones or release payments.
- Payments are only released for completed milestones.

## Disclaimer

This is a prototype for educational purposes. It should not be used in real-world applications without further development and security audits.
